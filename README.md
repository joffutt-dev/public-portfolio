# public-portfolio

This repository is designed to give general information about the owner of this github profile

## Passion Projects

Most of these public projects are technologies I wanted to explore more, or random ideas I wanted to pursue in my (increasingly sparse) free time. I love Computer Science and learning all about new solutions that developers come up with. Maybe someday, one of these passion projects will catch on

## Career Opportunities

If you are viewing this page in regards to career opportunities, thank you for taking the time to review my profile. Hopefully some of the ui designs and experience listed has impressed you. I look forward to assisting you with whatever technical challenges you may have.

### Coming Soon

- Better links between personal projects and technologies worked
- Expanded Skills Section, to include lesser used stacks and software items
