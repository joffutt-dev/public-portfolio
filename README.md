# public-portfolio

This repository is designed to give general information about the owner of this github profile

## Passion Projects

Most of these public projects are technologies I wanted to explore more, or random ideas I wanted to pursue in my (increasingly sparse) free time. I love Computer Science and think that in order to stay at the top of your game it requires pursuit of goals outside of a normal work week

## Career Opportunities

If you are viewing this page in regards to career opportunities, thank you for taking the time to review my profile. Hopefully some of the ui designs and experience listed has impressed you. I look forward to assisting you with whatever technical challenges you may have.
